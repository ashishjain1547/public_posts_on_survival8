<pre>
It was late at night.
The kind of night where the house feels smaller than usual, and sleep comes in patches.

The phone rang.

You know that sound — not the casual ring of a friend calling late, but the sharp, wrong kind of ring.
The kind that instantly wakes you up, even before you pick up the receiver.

A stranger’s voice told me my father had been rushed to the hospital.

From that moment on, time stopped behaving normally.
Days blurred into nights.
My mother and I sat beside his bed for two weeks, counting breaths, watching machines, hoping the zigzagging line on the screen would keep doing its job.

One quiet Sunday morning, it didn’t.

The line flattened.
Two men in black arrived.
And just like that, my father was gone.

I was an only child. Which meant grief didn’t arrive alone.
It came with logistics.

Comfort your mother.
Call relatives.
Organize the memorial.
Write the obituary.
Notify the banks.
Answer questions you don’t yet have answers to.

It was the busiest time of my life.

And one morning, after making sure my mother was cared for, I did something that probably looked selfish from the outside.

I got into my car.
And I drove.

Four hours.
Along narrow, winding roads.
Up the California coastline.

I didn’t have a destination in mind—just an instinct to keep moving until the noise inside me stopped shouting.

Eventually, I parked.
Stepped out.
Sat on a bench high above the sea.

And then something strange happened.

Nothing.

No one spoke.
No phone rang.
No opinion arrived demanding my attention.

There were bells tolling somewhere down the road.
Water cooling itself around the rocks.
Bees hovering around lavender.
Wind moving through tall grass like it had all the time in the world.

For two hours, I didn’t solve anything.
I didn’t analyze my feelings.
I didn’t “process” my grief.

I just sat there.

And when I finally got back into my car, I knew exactly what I needed to do next.

Not because I’d thought it through—
but because silence had cleared the argument.

I trust that kind of silence.

Because silence doesn’t try to win.

Words are always dividing us.
I believe this. You believe that.
I voted for them. You voted for these people.
I’m right—so you must be wrong.

But when people sit together in silence, something deeper happens.
You’re no longer defending an idea.
You’re just sharing a moment.

I know many people find this through yoga or meditation.
And that’s wonderful.
But I also know how intimidating those words can sound.

The beauty of silence is that it doesn’t require training.
Or belief.
Or a subscription.

It’s available to everyone.

You can find it in a church, even if you’re not religious.
In a quiet corner of your room.
In your car with the engine off.
For twenty minutes.
Or two hours.
Or just one deep breath.

And yes — we all know silence has a dark side too.

There’s the silence after an argument.
The silence that punishes.
The silence that threatens.
The silence that hurts more than a lie.

But that’s not the silence I’m talking about.

I mean the kind that feels alive.
The kind you can almost touch.

For me, it’s like stepping out of a crowded skyscraper and walking into an open field.
Getting out of your head.
And back into your senses.

Because let’s be honest—we’re drowning in noise.

Notifications.
Breaking news.
Opinions disguised as facts.
Facts disguised as outrage.

Sirens outside.
Construction everywhere.
A phone ringing mid-sentence—“Sorry, I have to take this.”

We can’t hear ourselves think.
Sometimes we can’t even hear the people we love.

And all we really want is a way to turn the volume down.

For the past 34 years, I’ve found that by stepping into silence whenever I can.
Sometimes for two weeks.
Sometimes for two days.
Sometimes—like after my father died—for just two hours.

It’s funny.
I’m not religious.
And yet, a Catholic retreat house has given me some of the clearest moments of my life.

Because when the mind grows quiet, something else wakes up.

You notice the light on the water.
The birdsong.
The ocean breathing far below.
Rabbits moving through the undergrowth.

You stop thinking so hard—and start listening.

And something else happens too.

When I spend time in silence, I feel closer to my friends.
Even when they’re not in the room.

I know what matters six months from now—
instead of panicking about what needs to happen six minutes from now.

I’m convinced the deepest part of us exists beyond language.

Of course, silence isn’t always peaceful.
Sometimes it’s just rain on the roof.
Or an old heater rattling.
Or a cabin shaking in the wind.

But even then, it offers release.

And when reality makes a house call—as it does in every life—when the phone rings in the middle of the night, or nurses rush in to check for a pulse — what you draw upon is your inner savings account.

And that account is built quietly.
Minute by minute.
Breath by breath.

Silence doesn’t ask you to believe anything.
It doesn’t care what side you’re on.
It reaches places no argument ever can.

Thomas Merton once wrote,
“When the mind is silent, the forest becomes magnificently real.”

Your phone is probably ringing right now.
The news is shouting again.
You’re worried about tomorrow.
About that conversation last night.
About the state of the world.

I know.

But think about the moments that truly matter—falling in love, watching a sunrise, losing someone you love.

The truest response is often no words at all.

We worry about climate change, wars, technologies moving faster than wisdom.
And we should.

But nearby is a quieter place — where debates stop, and reserves are built.

A place where we hear an intelligence that isn’t artificial.

So maybe—just for a moment—step there.

Nothing bad will come of it.

And something good—something useful—just might.

After a long week of words, what a relief it is to say nothing together.
