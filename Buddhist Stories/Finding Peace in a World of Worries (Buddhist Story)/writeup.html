<pre>
Friends, it is a matter of a long time ago, a young man lived in a city who was always troubled. All the time, various kinds of problems were going on in his life. He would try to solve his problems in every way. But every time he only got failure. Due to which he had become very upset. He was tired of his life. One day someone told him about a Buddhist monk. He told him that the Buddhist monk solves everyone's problems. You must meet him once. Hearing this, the young man decided that he would definitely meet that Buddhist monk. The very next day he set out to meet that Buddhist monk and after a long journey of about two days, he reached the ashram of that Buddhist monk.

Reaching there, he bowed to the Buddhist monk and then started saying to him, "O Gurudev, I have heard that you solve everyone's problems. I also have a problem. All kinds of troubles keep going on in my life. I am not able to solve them even if I want to. I tried many ways, tried many remedies, even after that, I don't know why my whole life has been stuck in these troubles. The more I try to get out of here, the more I get stuck in it. I don't see any way out. O Gurudev, please solve my problem. Show me a path by which I can solve all my problems. My life should be filled with happiness and I should not have any worries, no troubles."

The Buddhist monk listened to all the young man's words carefully and then he says to the young man, "Bhante, have you heard about bliss? The same bliss in which there is neither happiness nor sorrow. This is a state, after reaching which neither any kind of worry remains nor any kind of trouble, our life becomes blissful and we are able to live our life happily."

On this, the young man asks the Buddhist Mahatma, "O Gurudev, but how can I attain bliss?"

On that, the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "Bhante, for this you have to meditate, because meditation is the path through which you can attain bliss."

On this, the young man says to the Buddhist monk, "But O Gurudev, I do not want to meditate. Is there any other way by which all kinds of sorrows, all kinds of worries, all kinds of troubles from my life will end forever?"

On this, the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "Bhante, I will try to explain to you. If you listen to my words carefully, try to understand them, then you will surely understand how you can attain bliss in your life."

Further, the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "Close your eyes and just think what is there in your life today that was also in your life before and this same thing will be in your future life as well. We are human beings and the age of us human beings keeps on increasing continuously and with that, the desires and needs of us human beings also keep on increasing continuously. It does not matter whether that person is rich or poor or comes from the middle class, but that thing has spread a kind of restlessness in all our lives. It has snatched our life from us and what is that?"

Hearing this from the Guru, the young man fell into thought, what is that thing that has disturbed the peace of my life. Then the Buddhist monk, answering this question of the young man, says, "It is our desires. Whether we are young or old, whether we are rich or poor, but it is our desires that always keep troubling us and this is the one problem of all of us that keeps us suffering like this throughout our lives, keeps troubling us. We want to get rid of our troubles, but we are not able to get rid of our troubles even if we want to and during this time, many times it also seems to us that we have solved our problem, but as soon as we realize this, we come to know that another problem has come before us, due to which we were as happy as we were, once again we become as troubled as we were before. No matter how successful you are, no matter how rich you are, no matter how much wealth you have, but it does not have any effect on it. Whether you are a leader, an actor, an officer or a person of a high class, everyone is struggling with different kinds of problems. No matter what the circumstances are, everyone is troubled and if you look at your life carefully, you will find that we are not living our life but we are living the troubles."

After hearing all these things from the mouth of the Buddhist monk, the young man says to the Buddhist monk, "But O Maharaj, why are we all so troubled? What is the reason for this and is there no solution for it?"

In response to this, the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "Bhante, we are not all troubled because we have a very big problem in front of us. But we are troubled by this because many kinds of thoughts are going on in our mind. Problems have come in our life but they are not the cause of our trouble. The cause of our trouble is the thoughts of our mind and we have left the thoughts of our mind open in such a way that they keep affecting our life wherever they want, however they want. We have no control over those thoughts. That is why you must have seen that whether you want it or not, whether you think or not, but different kinds of thoughts keep running in your mind. If you have paid attention to yourself, then you must know that no matter what the state is, whether you are sad, happy or angry, all the time different kinds of thoughts are running in your mind and due to the running of these thoughts, our mind always tries to keep us busy and that is why we are not able to find a solution to our problems. We remain lost in those thoughts and due to these thoughts, we do not get a solution to any problem easily. Whether that problem is small or big and you must have also felt this at some point in your life that when the waves of thoughts are rising in your mind, you are completely immersed in your thoughts, in such a state when someone calls you, even then you are not able to hear that voice and in such a state when you are not able to hear his voice even after being called from outside, then how will you hear the inner voice? When you walk, we must hear the sound of your footsteps, but for that there should be complete silence around. On the other hand, if you are walking in a crowded area, then in such a situation you will only hear the noise of the surroundings of that crowded area. Not the sound of your footsteps, but when you go to a place where there is no one around, no kind of noise, there is complete silence all around, then you can easily hear the sound of your footsteps and in the same way our mind also works. That is, the thoughts of our mind, the noise of the thoughts of our mind is so much that if someone calls us, we cannot hear it. Whatever thoughts are in your inner mind, they want to talk to you, they want to put their words in front of you, but you can never hear them. In the outside world, that is, when any kind of thoughts arise in your brain, then through those thoughts you can do a lot in this outside world. You can even make a new invention. But when it comes to our inner mind, then these thoughts are nothing but like a stone in our path. Have you ever tried to see your thoughts? Have you tried to understand them? They are like a river and when there is a flood in the river, it carries you away and when you get carried away in your thoughts, then how will you reach the solution of your problem."

Further, the Buddhist monk, explaining to the young man, says, "What we are living in this world is not life but troubles, but we humans forget that life is truth and trouble is only a myth, but we only believe in troubles. We don't believe in life at all and when we have already believed in a myth, then how can we live our life? How can we improve our life? How can we eliminate trouble from our life forever? When you always live a life of lies, keep believing in it, then you will never be able to reach the truth. You will never be able to live your life because we have to take the help of our thoughts to experience anything and until your thoughts are controlled, you will never be able to enjoy your real life."

On this, the young man says to the monk, "So O Gurudev, what should I do now? How can I live my real life? How can I get rid of this myth-filled life full of troubles?"

Then the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "Bhante, close your eyes and experience what I am telling you." The young man obeyed the Buddhist monk. He did as he was told. Then the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "Suppose whatever you have today, whatever your relationships, whatever wealth, position, prestige, this respect you have, whatever your responsibilities are, whatever your troubles are, whatever your desires, wishes, lusts are, all have been snatched from you and now you have nothing left. Now you have only yourself and nothing else. Try to feel this in the depth of your inner mind, experience it. Make your brain realize this fact, think that whatever you had, whatever responsibilities, troubles, your relationship, wealth, home, even your own existence, everything has been snatched from you. You have nothing now. How are you feeling now?"

In response, the young man says to the Buddhist monk, "O Gurudev, it feels as if I am feeling very light. I have no worries, no troubles. I have nothing that would cause me pain, suffering. Now I am feeling very good. I am feeling very calm. I am feeling very blissful."

Further, the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "Now put all your attention on your breath, feel your breath. It is possible that during this time you may also hear the sounds of things around you, but do not pay attention to them, do not react to those sounds in any way, just keep all your attention on your breath and feel it, how those breaths are going in and how they are coming out." The young man obeyed the Buddhist monk and did the same.

After some time, the Buddhist monk once again said to the young man, "Now open your eyes and without reacting to any thought, pay attention to the things around you. Look at them carefully, you will surely see something new in all of them." The young man obeyed the Buddhist monk and did the same. For a while, everything seemed very good to him, everything seemed very new, but after some time he became sad again. He remembered his responsibilities, his troubles.

Then the Buddhist monk says to the young man, "The experience you have just had, you have to practice this experience every day. Whenever you go out, look at this world as if it has just been created. Assume that it is like your dreams where everything is a lie and only you are true and whatever happens in this world is because of your existence because it is your dream. Therefore, wherever you go, look at it very carefully, that path, those streets, but remember that when you are looking at them, do not react in any way to the thoughts arising in your mind at that time. It is possible that your mind may tell you that I have seen this many times, in such a situation you will have to stop your old thoughts from coming forward, that is, you will have to focus your attention on the things around you, you will have to experience them, you will have to feel them and yes, remember one more thing, this is not an ordinary thing that you did once and you will learn to be happy for your whole life forever. You will have to try for this and don't be in a hurry for it. You will have to pay attention to the fact that you are the only one in this whole world, there is no need to pay attention to anyone else, just look at yourself, focus your attention on things and to do this, choose a place where you can experience these things peacefully. You can feel these things and when you practice this continuously, you will surely feel bliss. Life will start to feel completely new. All kinds of sorrows of the mind will seem to end forever. Waves of happiness and bliss will start running in the mind and everything will change, everything will start to feel good, but for this you will have to practice continuously. It is not that you practiced today and you left it tomorrow. If you do this, you will never be able to feel bliss and until you can feel bliss, until you can feel it, this sorrow, these troubles, these problems will never end from your life and you will never be able to solve these problems, but if you practice it continuously, then gradually your mind will start to concentrate, you will learn to control your mind and when that happens, you will not get entangled in any kind of problem but will be able to find its solution, in any situation, in any circumstance you will be able to feel bliss. Sorrows, troubles, problems will seem to end forever from your life and you will be able to spend your life happily by living in bliss every moment."

Saying this, the Buddhist monk became silent and the young man had understood what he had to do now. He only paid attention to the words of the Buddhist monk and gradually changes started to come in his life. Now he started to be happier than before, started to feel lighter than before, he started to like his life now.

Friends, I know that we all have different kinds of problems in our lives, troubles and we feel that our troubles are the biggest and there is nothing bigger than this, but you are forgetting that you are bigger than those troubles and you are the one who can find a solution to those troubles, but you cannot find this solution until your mind is calm and until you calm your mind, control it, you will never be able to get out of your troubles, so do not let the troubles dominate you, but dominate the troubles yourself and try to find their solution and to do this you will need meditation. It is not necessary that you sit somewhere and meditate, you can do it while working, while walking or anything that you are already doing, just put your mind in that work, focus your entire attention on that work, by doing this your mind will surely stop you, but with continuous practice you will gain control over your mind and gradually your mind will become your slave and then wherever you want, however you want, whenever you want, your mind will be completely focused and you will be fully capable of fighting any trouble, any problem.
