    An economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before, but
    had recently failed an entire class.<br />
    <br />
    That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great
    equalizer.<br />
    <br />
    The professor then said, "OK, we will have an experiment in this class on this plan : All grades will be averaged
    and everyone will receive the same grade!<br />
    <br />
    After the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B.<br />
    <br />
    The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy.<br />
    <br />
    As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied
    hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little.<br />
    <br />
    The second test average was a D! <br />
    <br />
    No one was happy. <br />
    <br />
    When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F!<br />
    <br />
    As the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard
    feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.<br />
    <br />
    To their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that communism would also ultimately fail because
    when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one
    will try or want to succeed. <br />
    <br />
    These are possibly the 5 best sentences you'll ever read and all applicable to this experiment :<br />
    <br />
    1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.<br />
    <br />
    2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.<br />
    <br />
    3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.<br />
    <br />
    4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.<br />
    <br />
    5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care
    of them and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get
    what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.
