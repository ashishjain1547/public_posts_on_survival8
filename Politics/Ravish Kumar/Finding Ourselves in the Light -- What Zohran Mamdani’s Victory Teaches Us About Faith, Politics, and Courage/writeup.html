<div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full break-words light markdown-new-styling">

<p data-start="130" data-end="335">“I will not change how I eat. I will not change the faith I am proud to belong to. But there is one thing I will change — I will no longer look for myself in the shadow. I will find myself in the light.”</p>
<p data-start="337" data-end="573">With these words, <strong data-start="366" data-end="382">Zohran Mamdani</strong> set the tone for what his historic mayoral campaign in New York represents — not just for America, but for democracies around the world where religion is weaponized to divide.</p>
<p data-start="575" data-end="719">Mamdani’s campaign and triumph answered two age-old questions: <em data-start="638" data-end="677">Can faith be separated from politics?</em> And more importantly, <em data-start="700" data-end="717">why must it be?</em></p>
<p data-start="721" data-end="873">His win proved that while religion might never be fully absent from politics, the politics of <strong data-start="815" data-end="847">hate in the name of religion</strong> can indeed be defeated.</p>
<hr data-start="875" data-end="878">
<h3 data-start="880" data-end="941">A Muslim Candidate Who Refused to Be a “Muslim Candidate”</h3>
<p data-start="943" data-end="1069">What makes Zohran Mamdani’s journey remarkable is that he never hid his Muslim identity, nor did he seek votes in its name.</p>
<p data-start="1071" data-end="1323">His supporters urged him to stay silent when attacked for being Muslim. But he chose speech over silence. He told New Yorkers — yes, he was a Muslim, but above all, he was a <strong data-start="1245" data-end="1256">citizen</strong> seeking the same dignity and equality every New Yorker deserved.</p>
<p data-start="1325" data-end="1496">“I am a Muslim,” he said, “but I am not a Muslim candidate. I want to be a leader who fights for every New Yorker — no matter their skin color, religion, or birthplace.”</p>
<p data-start="1498" data-end="1588">That clarity disarmed his opponents. He didn’t run <em data-start="1549" data-end="1555">from</em> his identity; he transcended it.</p>
<hr data-start="1590" data-end="1593">
<h3 data-start="1595" data-end="1647">The Politics of Dignity vs. The Politics of Fear</h3>
<p data-start="1649" data-end="1848">For over two decades after 9/11, American Muslims lived under suspicion. Hate was institutionalized — from the airport to the ballot box. Mamdani, a son of immigrants, walked right into that storm.</p>
<p data-start="1850" data-end="2051">Opponents painted him as dangerous. Ads funded by billionaires showed his beard exaggerated, his image darkened. TV hosts accused him of wanting to “chair another 9/11.” Others mocked the way he ate.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2098">It was Islamophobia with corporate funding.</p>
<p data-start="2100" data-end="2291">Mamdani’s answer was radical — not anger, but empathy. He spoke not just for Muslims, but for <em data-start="2194" data-end="2224">all marginalized New Yorkers</em>: the ones who couldn’t afford bus fares, housing, or healthcare.</p>
<p data-start="2293" data-end="2346">His campaign revolved around simple, humane issues:</p>
<ul data-start="2347" data-end="2536">
<li data-start="2347" data-end="2402">
<p data-start="2349" data-end="2402"><strong data-start="2349" data-end="2374">Free public transport</strong> for working-class people.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2403" data-end="2485">
<p data-start="2405" data-end="2485"><strong data-start="2405" data-end="2427">Affordable housing</strong> in a city where the poor are being pushed farther away.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2486" data-end="2536">
<p data-start="2488" data-end="2536"><strong data-start="2488" data-end="2507">Dignity for all</strong>, regardless of background.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2538" data-end="2602">He reframed the debate — from <em data-start="2568" data-end="2581">who belongs</em> to <em data-start="2585" data-end="2599">who benefits</em>.</p>
<hr data-start="2604" data-end="2607">
<h3 data-start="2609" data-end="2647">Hate Has Billion-Dollar Sponsors</h3>
<p data-start="2649" data-end="2765">Mamdani pulled the curtain on something most politicians avoid discussing — how <strong data-start="2729" data-end="2762">corporate money sustains hate</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2767" data-end="2900">He named companies that funded his opponent’s Islamophobic propaganda. “They don’t fear my faith,” he said, “they fear fair wages.”</p>
<p data-start="2902" data-end="3017">If workers gain power, corporations lose profits. So they distract the public — through hate, fear, and division.</p>
<p data-start="3019" data-end="3039">As Mamdani put it:</p>
<blockquote data-start="3040" data-end="3238">
<p data-start="3042" data-end="3238">“The billionaire class seeks to convince those making $30 an hour that their enemies are those earning $20 an hour. They want us to fight each other, so we forget who truly controls the system.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="3240" data-end="3308">It’s the same playbook used across the world — including in India.</p>
<hr data-start="3310" data-end="3313">
<h3 data-start="3315" data-end="3338">Lessons for India</h3>
<p data-start="3340" data-end="3631">India’s politics runs on similar fuel.<br data-start="3378" data-end="3381">
While millions struggle for food, jobs, and education, leaders keep the nation busy fighting <em data-start="3474" data-end="3493">imaginary enemies</em>.<br data-start="3494" data-end="3497">
The politics of “send them to Pakistan” and “illegal infiltrators” thrives because it’s easier to inflame hatred than to fix hunger.</p>
<p data-start="3633" data-end="3806">Even opposition leaders, fearing electoral backlash, shy away from openly supporting Muslim voices or religious minorities.<br data-start="3756" data-end="3759">
They whisper when courage demands they speak.</p>
<p data-start="3808" data-end="4020">Mamdani did the opposite — he <em data-start="3838" data-end="3868">stood beside Imams in public</em>, he <em data-start="3873" data-end="3900">embraced his faith openly</em>, and yet, he never made it his electoral plank.<br data-start="3948" data-end="3951">
He showed that the antidote to fear is not silence, but visibility.</p>
<p data-start="4022" data-end="4123">His politics wasn’t about <em data-start="4048" data-end="4057">Muslims</em>, it was about <em data-start="4072" data-end="4085">New Yorkers</em> — and that made all the difference.</p>
<hr data-start="4125" data-end="4128">
<h3 data-start="4130" data-end="4180">A New Kind of Campaign: Humanity as Strategy</h3>
<p data-start="4182" data-end="4256">Mamdani’s campaign turned issues like bus fares into symbols of justice.</p>
<p data-start="4258" data-end="4423">New York’s working class — 1.3 million people who commute by bus daily — became central to his vision.<br data-start="4360" data-end="4363">
Slow buses meant lost hours, lost wages, and lost dignity.</p>
<p data-start="4425" data-end="4539">By fighting for faster, cheaper public transport, Mamdani wasn’t just talking policy — he was talking <em data-start="4527" data-end="4536">respect</em>.</p>
<p data-start="4541" data-end="4592">He made the working person’s time valuable again.</p>
<p data-start="4594" data-end="4744">It’s a politics India’s cities could learn from — where millions commute for hours each day, losing health and hope while leaders argue about faith.</p>
<hr data-start="4746" data-end="4749">
<h3 data-start="4751" data-end="4785">Beyond Religion, Beyond Hate</h3>
<p data-start="4787" data-end="4854">Zohran Mamdani’s victory is more than electoral. It’s <strong data-start="4842" data-end="4851">moral</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="4856" data-end="5089">It proved that people can see through billion-dollar propaganda.<br data-start="4920" data-end="4923">
That the politics of fear, no matter how powerful, cannot outlast the politics of belonging.<br data-start="5015" data-end="5018">
That you can be proud of your faith without turning it into a weapon.</p>
<p data-start="5091" data-end="5258">In a world increasingly consumed by division, Mamdani’s campaign feels like the fresh air Ravish Kumar described — the air many nations are still waiting to breathe.</p>
<hr data-start="5260" data-end="5263">
<h3 data-start="5265" data-end="5298">The Light We Must Step Into</h3>
<p data-start="5300" data-end="5396">Zohran Mamdani's line now reads less like a statement and more like a manifesto for our times:</p>
<blockquote data-start="5398" data-end="5484">
<p data-start="5400" data-end="5484">“I will no longer look for myself in the shadow. I will find myself in the light.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="5486" data-end="5617">Mamdani found his light — not by abandoning faith or identity, but by refusing to let them be twisted into tools of fear.</p>
<p data-start="5619" data-end="5794">The rest of us — in Delhi, in Lucknow, in New York — might ask:<br data-start="5682" data-end="5685">
Are we still living in the shadows others built for us?<br data-start="5740" data-end="5743">
Or are we ready to walk into the light ourselves?</p>
<hr data-start="5796" data-end="5799">
<p data-start="5801" data-end="6018" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">
In defeating the politics of hate, Zohran Mamdani hasn’t just changed New York — he’s offered a lesson for the world: <em data-start="5941" data-end="6018" data-is-last-node="">the future belongs not to those who divide, but to those who dare to unite.</em></p></div>
