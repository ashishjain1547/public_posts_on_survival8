<p data-start="343" data-end="413"><strong data-start="343" data-end="413">By Ravish Kumar</strong></p>
<p data-start="415" data-end="663">A strange debate has taken root in Bihar. A debate between <em data-start="474" data-end="480">reel</em> and <em data-start="485" data-end="494">rozgaar</em> — between short-form video entertainment and real employment.<br data-start="556" data-end="559">
Rahul Gandhi calls reels an addiction. Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls them a source of employment.</p>
<p data-start="665" data-end="992">At a recent rally in Bihar, the Prime Minister proudly claimed that his government made data cheaper, and as a result, Bihar’s youth are earning through reels.<br data-start="824" data-end="827">
It was meant to sound like a story of digital empowerment. In truth, it revealed the tragic distance between politics and the real lives of Bihar’s young generation.</p>
<hr data-start="994" data-end="997">
<h3 data-start="999" data-end="1048"><strong data-start="1003" data-end="1048">The Cost of a Dream Called “Reel Economy”</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1050" data-end="1439">If reel-making were truly a viable employment model, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar — who has ruled the state for nearly two decades — wouldn’t be distributing unemployment allowances and election-time stipends to women.<br data-start="1267" data-end="1270">
He’d be giving ₹10,000 to every youth to start making reels — because, as the Prime Minister suggests, Bihar’s youth can now “earn from creativity” thanks to cheap data.</p>
<p data-start="1441" data-end="1515">But ask the young creators themselves, and a very different story emerges.</p>
<p data-start="1517" data-end="1899">They tell you: one reel takes 5–6 hours to make, often shot under the sun or in the rain, edited painstakingly on a phone they bought on loan.<br data-start="1659" data-end="1662">
Their content gets views, but not revenue. Ad deals are rare, local sponsors pay ₹1000–₹2000, and platforms like Instagram don’t pay creators at all.<br data-start="1811" data-end="1814">
For most, “reel-making” is not an income — it’s an expensive hobby sustained by hope.</p>
<p data-start="1901" data-end="2076">One student from Samastipur shared how he borrowed ₹32,000 from his mother to buy a phone, promising to pay it back from his “reel income.” Months later, he’s still in debt.</p>
<hr data-start="2078" data-end="2081">
<h3 data-start="2083" data-end="2124"><strong data-start="2087" data-end="2124">Cheap Data or Costly Distraction?</strong></h3>
<p data-start="2126" data-end="2588">The Prime Minister claims data is cheaper than tea.<br data-start="2177" data-end="2180">
But the reality on the ground contradicts that. Over the past year, data rates have <em data-start="2264" data-end="2271">risen</em> by 20–25%. Entry-level recharge plans have been scrapped by major telecoms.<br data-start="2347" data-end="2350">
Airtel’s ₹249 plan is now ₹299, and Jio’s basic 1GB-per-day plan doesn’t exist anymore.<br data-start="2437" data-end="2440">
When young creators say uploading a single video consumes 500–600MB, you realize that this “cheap data” narrative is detached from the ground truth.</p>
<p data-start="2590" data-end="2903">It’s one thing to have mobile phones in every home. It’s another to have genuine <em data-start="2671" data-end="2692">digital empowerment</em>.<br data-start="2693" data-end="2696">
Only around <strong data-start="2708" data-end="2757">43% of Bihar’s population has internet access</strong>, far below Kerala’s 70%.<br data-start="2782" data-end="2785">
Barely <strong data-start="2792" data-end="2900">1% of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, and extremely backward-class households own a laptop or computer</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2905" data-end="3029">So even if data were free, how would Bihar’s youth turn it into employment when the basic digital infrastructure is missing?</p>
<hr data-start="3031" data-end="3034">
<h3 data-start="3036" data-end="3077"><strong data-start="3040" data-end="3077">The Barren Landscape of Real Jobs</strong></h3>
<p data-start="3079" data-end="3289">Aditya Anand, a young professional from Munger, wrote a viral post on LinkedIn about this illusion of opportunity.<br data-start="3193" data-end="3196">
He called Bihar the perfect example of how India is squandering its <em data-start="3264" data-end="3286">demographic dividend</em>.</p>
<p data-start="3291" data-end="3306">In his words:</p>
<blockquote data-start="3307" data-end="3498">
<p data-start="3309" data-end="3498">“Half the youth here are preparing for government jobs that never come. The other half are scrolling American apps on Chinese phones, cursing both countries while trapped in their systems.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="3500" data-end="3738">His observation captures the paradox: a state overflowing with youth energy, yet starved of opportunities.<br data-start="3606" data-end="3609">
Gyms are full, coaching centres are crowded, and reels are endless — but factories, startups, and meaningful jobs remain missing.</p>
<hr data-start="3740" data-end="3743">
<h3 data-start="3745" data-end="3776"><strong data-start="3749" data-end="3776">Politics of Distraction</strong></h3>
<p data-start="3778" data-end="3998">From <em data-start="3783" data-end="3802">pakora employment</em> in 2019 to <em data-start="3814" data-end="3831">reel employment</em> in 2025, the slogans have changed but the reality hasn’t.<br data-start="3889" data-end="3892">
What remains constant is the government’s attempt to rename or reframe unemployment as entrepreneurship.</p>
<p data-start="4000" data-end="4317">The Prime Minister says “reel-making is work.” But he doesn’t say which colleges, universities, or industries his government has strengthened to create real jobs.<br data-start="4162" data-end="4165">
He doesn’t explain why <strong data-start="4188" data-end="4208">Patna University</strong>, established in 1917, still awaits central university status — a promise dismissed on stage eight years ago.</p>
<p data-start="4319" data-end="4571">When asked about factories, BJP leaders say there’s no land in Bihar.<br data-start="4388" data-end="4391">
Yet, the same state provides lakhs of migrants who build cities in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Delhi.<br data-start="4490" data-end="4493">
The land is apparently too scarce for factories, but not for election rallies.</p>
<hr data-start="4573" data-end="4576">
<h3 data-start="4578" data-end="4621"><strong data-start="4582" data-end="4621">The Global Lens: Reels as Addiction</strong></h3>
<p data-start="4623" data-end="4997">Rahul Gandhi called reels a “nasha” — an addiction.<br data-start="4674" data-end="4677">
And he’s not wrong. Globally, research is piling up on the psychological impact of social media reels: reduced attention span, rising anxiety, depression, and addiction among children and young adults.<br data-start="4878" data-end="4881">
In the U.S., parents have even sued Facebook and Instagram, blaming them for mental health issues in their children.</p>
<p data-start="4999" data-end="5213">Yet, India’s Prime Minister celebrates the same platforms as vehicles of employment.<br data-start="5083" data-end="5086">
No country that takes youth mental health seriously would glorify an addictive technology as a source of national productivity.</p>
<hr data-start="5215" data-end="5218">
<h3 data-start="5220" data-end="5262"><strong data-start="5224" data-end="5262">The Digital Illusion of Employment</strong></h3>
<p data-start="5264" data-end="5550">It’s important to understand that content creation is indeed an economy — but <strong data-start="5342" data-end="5384">not one built by the Indian government</strong>.<br data-start="5385" data-end="5388">
It exists because of global platforms like YouTube, Google, Meta, and X.<br data-start="5460" data-end="5463">
Governments have, in fact, made this space more fragile through restrictive IT rules.</p>
<p data-start="5552" data-end="5906">The 2021 amendments to India’s IT Act allow bureaucrats to order the removal of online content without transparent justification.<br data-start="5681" data-end="5684">
Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) have challenged this in court.<br data-start="5750" data-end="5753">
This means even the little economic opportunity that YouTube creators or independent journalists found online exists under constant threat of censorship.</p>
<p data-start="5908" data-end="6034">So, when the Prime Minister takes credit for “creating” a reel economy, it’s misleading — both economically and politically.</p>
<hr data-start="6036" data-end="6039">
<h3 data-start="6041" data-end="6098"><strong data-start="6045" data-end="6098">Bihar’s Young, Stuck Between Hope and Deprivation</strong></h3>
<p data-start="6100" data-end="6365">Bihar is India’s youngest state — about 10% of India’s youth live there.<br data-start="6172" data-end="6175">
Yet, its unemployment rate remains among the highest.<br data-start="6228" data-end="6231">
For 20 years, one chief minister and one alliance have ruled, claiming “double engine” governance.<br data-start="6329" data-end="6332">
But what has that engine built?</p>
<p data-start="6367" data-end="6540">Education remains in ruins.<br data-start="6394" data-end="6397">
Industries are absent.<br data-start="6419" data-end="6422">
And instead of modern universities or IT hubs, the youth are offered cheap data and motivational speeches about reels.</p>
<p data-start="6542" data-end="6658">In a state where 98% of households lack computers, what sense does it make to talk about digital entrepreneurship?</p>
<hr data-start="6660" data-end="6663">
<h3 data-start="6665" data-end="6690"><strong data-start="6669" data-end="6690">The Real Question</strong></h3>
<p data-start="6692" data-end="6916">The real question is not whether making reels is good or bad.<br data-start="6753" data-end="6756">
It’s whether the government can get away with calling it <em data-start="6813" data-end="6825">employment</em> in a state that desperately needs factories, universities, and functioning institutions.</p>
<p data-start="6918" data-end="7107">If reels are truly the future of jobs, perhaps our leaders should also quit politics and start making them.<br data-start="7025" data-end="7028">
They might discover, as Bihar’s youth already have, that likes don’t pay bills.</p>
<hr data-start="7109" data-end="7112">
<h3 data-start="7114" data-end="7166"><strong data-start="7118" data-end="7166">Conclusion: Between Red Light and Blue Light</strong></h3>
<p data-start="7168" data-end="7454">Bihar’s nights glow with the blue light of mobile screens — not the lamps of study or the sparks of industry.<br data-start="7277" data-end="7280">
The young scroll endlessly, not out of joy, but out of boredom and helplessness.<br data-start="7360" data-end="7363">
Every reel is a cry of creativity trapped inside a system that refuses to open its doors.</p>
<p data-start="7456" data-end="7581">The tragedy is not that Bihar’s youth are making reels.<br data-start="7511" data-end="7514">
The tragedy is that the country’s leaders now call it <em data-start="7568" data-end="7580">employment</em>.</p>
