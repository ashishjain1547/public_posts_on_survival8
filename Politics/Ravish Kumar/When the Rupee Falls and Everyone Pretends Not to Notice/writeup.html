<div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full break-words light markdown-new-styling">
<p data-start="255" data-end="571">What kind of music plays in your head when you look at the Indian rupee today? Sad music… or dance music?<br data-start="360" data-end="363">
Because the Election Commission recently posted a video telling stressed BLOs to <em data-start="444" data-end="451">dance</em> — even as many of them are dying on duty. So should we listen to dance beats while the rupee collapses? Or sad violins?</p>
<p data-start="573" data-end="822">Why is no one asking why the rupee is falling so badly? And if the rupee is in such terrible condition, what must be happening to the common citizen? What does the future hold for this currency, for you, for the country? There is silence everywhere.</p>
<p data-start="824" data-end="956">Every day a small headline appears:<br data-start="859" data-end="862">
<strong data-start="862" data-end="892">“Rupee hits all-time low.”</strong><br data-start="892" data-end="895">
But beyond that—no explanation, no debate, no accountability.</p>
<p data-start="958" data-end="1279">The Prime Minister says, <em data-start="983" data-end="1005">“Enjoy the weather.”</em><br data-start="1005" data-end="1008">
Meanwhile the rupee keeps sliding. Why tell people to enjoy the weather? To distract them from the economic storm? After all, he once said that a falling rupee reflects a weak Prime Minister and declining national prestige. So what does the rupee’s current free fall say?</p>
<p data-start="1281" data-end="1460">The dollar strengthens, the rupee weakens.<br data-start="1323" data-end="1326">
Indian traders exporting and importing goods can’t absorb this blow. Even the government faces rising costs. Yet Delhi remains silent.</p>
<p data-start="1462" data-end="1661">Look around: Nepal’s currency is stable. Bangladesh? No problem. Pakistan? No major shock. Sri Lanka? Even after its crisis, their currency isn’t plunging like ours.<br data-start="1627" data-end="1630">
Why is <strong data-start="1637" data-end="1652">India alone</strong> sinking?</p>
<p data-start="1663" data-end="1820">And let me say this clearly: this is not just economics. Corrupt politics from Delhi plays a huge role. It’s a serious allegation, but someone has to say it.</p>
<p data-start="1822" data-end="2058">We are told we have the “strongest Prime Minister ever,” yet the rupee has fallen <strong data-start="1904" data-end="1929">4.6% in a single year</strong> — the steepest in Asia. The worst-performing currency in the entire region is the Indian rupee. Where do we go to ask questions?</p>
<p data-start="2060" data-end="2147">Shall we call Nehru?<br data-start="2080" data-end="2083">
During his tenure, one dollar was worth ₹4.<br data-start="2126" data-end="2129">
And today? ₹89.41.</p>
<p data-start="2149" data-end="2190">Who will explain this historic weakening?</p>
<p data-start="2192" data-end="2384">But instead of an explanation, we are told to enjoy the weather. Why not enjoy the rupee too? Why not laugh at all-time lows? Why not celebrate that India now has the weakest currency in Asia?</p>
<p data-start="2386" data-end="2575">Not just against the dollar — but also the euro, the pound, the yuan, and the yen.<br data-start="2468" data-end="2471">
1 euro recently crossed <strong data-start="2495" data-end="2503">₹145</strong>.<br data-start="2504" data-end="2507">
1 dollar: weaker by ₹5 in a single year.<br data-start="2547" data-end="2550">
1 pound: around <strong data-start="2566" data-end="2574">₹115</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2577" data-end="2625">Is this “prestige”? Is this “global leadership”?</p>
<p data-start="2627" data-end="2694">GDP numbers come — 8.2%.<br data-start="2651" data-end="2654">
Celebrations erupt. Tweets everywhere.</p>
<p data-start="2696" data-end="2868">But 80 crore people survive on free rations. Millions will sell their vote for ₹10,000. How can a country with such poverty also have “the world’s fastest-growing economy”?</p>
<p data-start="2870" data-end="3039">If GDP is booming and inflation is low, why is the rupee not strengthening? Why are foreign investors withdrawing billions? Why is the RBI unable to defend the currency?</p>
<p data-start="3041" data-end="3185">Now a new theory is being pushed:<br data-start="3074" data-end="3077">
“We <em data-start="3081" data-end="3087">want</em> a weaker rupee. If the rupee falls to 90, imports will reduce and the trade deficit will shrink.”</p>
<p data-start="3187" data-end="3369">Amazing logic.<br data-start="3201" data-end="3204">
As if industries import raw materials by checking the rupee–dollar rate on a calculator. If you stop importing essential goods, production stops. How does that help?</p>
<p data-start="3371" data-end="3522">But logic is optional when voters are given free rations and occasional cash transfers. People don’t ask questions when they are struggling to survive.</p>
<p data-start="3524" data-end="3681">If the government truly believes the rupee’s fall is good, let them explain it in Parliament. They win every election anyway. What stops them from answering?</p>
<p data-start="3683" data-end="3883">Look at 2013. When the rupee touched 63, there was national outrage. Tea stall experts became overnight currency analysts. Today at 89, everyone is smiling in photos and saying, <em data-start="3861" data-end="3883">“Enjoy the weather.”</em></p>
<p data-start="3885" data-end="4020">Foreign investors pulled out ₹4,000 crore in just two days recently. But no prime-time debate. No screaming anchors. No accountability.</p>
<p data-start="4022" data-end="4147">Why?<br data-start="4026" data-end="4029">
Because institutions now have weak leadership installed everywhere.<br data-start="4096" data-end="4099">
No one will question.<br data-start="4120" data-end="4123">
No one will investigate.</p>
<p data-start="4149" data-end="4458">Meanwhile, the Prime Minister speaks endlessly — but not about the rupee, not about electoral irregularities, not about the deaths of BLOs, not about rising foreign investment outflows. Religious events get attention, spiritual messages get attention, mythology gets attention — everything except the economy.</p>
<p data-start="4460" data-end="4653">The media has ensured the public stops thinking.<br data-start="4508" data-end="4511">
Opposition leaders have doors slammed shut across TV channels.<br data-start="4573" data-end="4576">
Only tweets, reels, and YouTube remain.<br data-start="4615" data-end="4618">
And even those barely reach people.</p>
<p data-start="4655" data-end="4725">Economic inequality rises.<br data-start="4681" data-end="4684">
Information inequality rises even faster.</p>
<p data-start="4727" data-end="4980">Tata’s semiconductor project gets enormous subsidies — ₹44,000 crore, according to reports — and the same company donates ₹750 crore to the ruling party.<br data-start="4880" data-end="4883">
Can the opposition match that?<br data-start="4913" data-end="4916">
No wonder their voice disappears from Parliament to the streets.</p>
<p data-start="4982" data-end="5168">And in this entire noise, the politics of silence around the rupee pushes citizens into a dark tunnel. At the far end of that tunnel, a few of us stand — still trying to warn the public.</p>
<p data-start="5170" data-end="5384">India’s rupee has weakened.<br data-start="5197" data-end="5200">
It is Asia’s worst-performing currency.<br data-start="5239" data-end="5242">
It has fallen against every major global currency.<br data-start="5292" data-end="5295">
It has been falling all year.<br data-start="5324" data-end="5327">
And the nation is being told to simply enjoy the weather.</p>
<p data-start="5386" data-end="5414"><em data-start="5386" data-end="5414">Namaskar.<br data-start="5396" data-end="5399">
