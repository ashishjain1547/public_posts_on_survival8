<pre>FM Nirmala Sitharaman began her Union Budget 2021 speech at 11 am Monday amid heckling by parliamentarians. Among big-ticket measures, FM proposed a Rs 64,180-crore Aatmanirbhar Swastha Bharat scheme in view of the pandemic. 
"Only three times has the Budget followed a contraction in the economy. This time, unlike before, the situation is due to a global pandemic. Budget 2021 provides every opportunity for the economy to capture the pace and grow sustainably," she began. 
The Budget 2021 proposals rest on six pillars —health & well-being, physical & financial capital & infrastructure, inclusive development for aspirational India, reinvigorating human capital, innovation & research & development, minimum government and maximum governance, she added. 
Benchmark stock indices Nifty and Sensex gave a thumbs up to government's 'expansionary budget' as FM Sitharaman chose the path of additional borrowing instead of taxing the super-rich or raising taxes on high-income individuals.  
The FM had earlier promised a "never before" budget not seen in a hundred years to ward off the economic devastation caused by a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic which rendered millions out of jobs, shuttered scores of small businesses and snuffed the spending power of the bottom of pyramid populace. 
FM said the government will borrow about Rs 12 lakh crore in FY22, adding that the expenditure for the next fiscal has been pegged at Rs 34.83 lakh crore, which includes Rs 5.54 lakh crore of capital expenditure. The fiscal deficit for FY21 was pegged at 9.5% of GDP and will come down to 6.8 per cent in FY22, she added. 
The FM added that the government will approach the market to borrow an additional Rs 80,000 crore to fund the FY21 fiscal deficit. <span style="display: none;">Ref: <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/budget/blog/indian-union-budget-speech-2021-22-live-news-updates-nirmala-sitharaman/527" target="_blank">Excerpt from speech</a></span>

<b>Industry Reviews</b>

- Bullion industry lauds the move of the government to cut customs duty on gold and silver, which was a long-standing demand of the industry. Government has announced in the Budget 2021 to reduce import duty on precious metals to 7.5% from 12.5%. However, both will attract 2.5% of agriculture infrastructure and development cess. 

- Being the world's second-largest gold consumer, India imports the bulk of its gold and silver requirements. Since the prices of precious metals have surged sharply in 2020, physical demand plummeted and imports have tumbled to multi-year lows. The total levy on gold currently is at 15.5 per cent, including GST. With reduced duty, the cost will come down, which is a big positive in long term for the demand outlook of gold. 

- Startups, their employees and investors, including venture capital and private equity funds, had a lot of expectations from the Union Budget 2021, while some measures were announced, there was a lot left to be desired as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman focused on healthcare and infrastructure spending in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Though there were no announcements which put the industry into a frenzy—like a proposed ban on cryptocurrencies two years ago and the angel tax issue—a lot of areas where founders and investors expected reform did not happen, while the areas the government did address seem to be incremental, writes M Sriram.

- The Budget has proposed to set the ball rolling for a long term strong growth with focus on infrastructure and banking reforms. The inclusion of off balance sheet items also signals a clear intention of the government towards a transparent accounting. <span style="display: none;">Ref: <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/union-budget-2021-live-updates-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-income-tax-news-narendra-modi-rail-psb-banks-psu-privatisation-cryptocurrency-ban-6422111.html" target="_blank">moneycontrol</a></span>

# IT relaxation for senior citizens of 75 years age and above:
It has been proposed to exempt the senior citizens from filing income tax returns if pension income and interest income are their only annual income source.

# National Faceless Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Centre:
Provision is made for faceless proceedings before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in a jurisdiction less manner. It will reduce the cost of compliance for taxpayers, and increase transparency in the disposal of appeals.

The tax holiday for startups has been extended by one more year up to 31st March 2022.

# Relaxations to NRI:
There is a proposal to notify rules for removing hardship for double taxation.

# Section 43CA stands amended:
The stamp duty value can be up to 120% (earlier 110%) of the consideration if the transfer of “residential unit”, which means an independent housing unit is made between 12th November 2020 and 30th June 2021.

<h4>Congress Leader Chidambaram slams govt</h4>

Although the government has claimed a massive increase of 137 per cent in health allocation in Budget 2021, Congress leader P. Chidambaram lashed out at the Centre saying the figure was just a "conjurer's trick." Chidambaram further said that the government had only marginally raised health funding, which when adjusted to inflation becomes nil.

"The FM gave out a mind-boggling figure of Rs 2,23,846 crore for health, a breathtaking "rise" from the BE of the current year of Rs 94,452 crore. As I had warned, it was a conjurer's trick," he said. Chidambaram stated that "she (FM Sitharaman) added the one-time cost of vaccination ((Rs 35,000 crore) and the Finance Commission grants amounting to Rs 49,214 crore. She also included the allocations to the Department of Water and Sanitation." <span style="display: none;">Ref: <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2021/news/budget-2021-live-updates-nirmala-sitharaman-speech-income-tax-slab-healthcare-education-economy/story/429760.html" target="_blank">BusinessToday</a></span>
