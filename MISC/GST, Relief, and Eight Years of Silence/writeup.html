<div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full break-words light markdown-new-styling"><p data-start="0" data-end="191">
<p data-start="243" data-end="269">Hello, I’m Ravish Kumar.</p>
<p data-start="271" data-end="601">Today we talk about two stories: one is about a government decision, the other about the discussion it provokes. For the first time in eight years, the Modi government has admitted—though indirectly—that GST (Goods and Services Tax) hurt the people. That inflation crushed households. That savings have dropped to historic lows.</p>
<p data-start="603" data-end="972">The same GST that was once defended as a “reform” has now been quietly rolled back in scope. Rates have been reduced, slabs simplified. The government calls it <em data-start="763" data-end="771">relief</em>. Posters and press releases celebrate: “Your daily expenses will now be cheaper.” But let’s not forget—yesterday the same taxes were called “reform,” while Rahul Gandhi called it “Gabbar Singh Tax.”</p>
<p data-start="974" data-end="1050">So what was it all these years? Relief today means exploitation yesterday.</p>
<hr data-start="1052" data-end="1055">
<h2 data-start="1057" data-end="1083">Eight Years of Denial</h2>
<p data-start="1084" data-end="1325">From Arun Jaitley to Nirmala Sitharaman, the government defended the GST structure tooth and nail. They told us multiple tax slabs were necessary. They claimed high rates were justified. And anyone who questioned it was mocked or silenced.</p>
<p data-start="1327" data-end="1689">But the results were plain: small shopkeepers crushed by compliance, medium businesses suffocated by paperwork, households drained of every rupee. Inflation soared while incomes stagnated. People skipped health insurance because 18% GST made premiums unaffordable. Parents struggled with school supplies because even pencils, erasers, and notebooks were taxed.</p>
<p data-start="1691" data-end="1790">Now, after eight years, the government accepts what was obvious to millions: GST hurt the people.</p>
<hr data-start="1792" data-end="1795">
<h2 data-start="1797" data-end="1826">The Politics of “Relief”</h2>
<p data-start="1827" data-end="2062">The GST Council has now reduced the slabs from six to two main ones: 5% and 18%. A third, 40%, remains for luxury and sin goods. Items from soap to bicycles, from baby diapers to health insurance, have been shifted to lower brackets.</p>
<p data-start="2064" data-end="2166">The government calls it “a Diwali gift.” But gifts come from generosity—this is merely undoing harm.</p>
<p data-start="2168" data-end="2497">If this relief was possible now, why not earlier? Why did people have to pay 12% GST on school notebooks for eight years? Why did parents pay 18% on shampoo and toothpaste, while the government defended it? Why did it take almost a decade to acknowledge the obvious—that ordinary people were being looted in the name of reform?</p>
<hr data-start="2499" data-end="2502">
<h2 data-start="2504" data-end="2536">The Opposition’s Loneliness</h2>
<p data-start="2537" data-end="2843">Throughout these eight years, Rahul Gandhi was mocked for calling GST “Gabbar Singh Tax.” He repeatedly demanded simplification and a cap at 18%. In 2016, he warned that anything higher would crush the poor and the small trader. He was ridiculed by the media, attacked by IT cells, dismissed as ignorant.</p>
<p data-start="2845" data-end="2914">Yet here we are, eight years later, doing exactly what he proposed.</p>
<p data-start="2916" data-end="2993">So the question is: was Rahul Gandhi wrong, or was the government arrogant?</p>
<hr data-start="2995" data-end="2998">
<h2 data-start="3000" data-end="3018">The Real Cost</h2>
<p data-start="3019" data-end="3387">Relief today doesn’t erase the suffering of the past. Countless households emptied their savings. Small businesses folded. Farmers and workers bore the brunt of inflation. Parents cut corners on children’s education and health. Gig workers, already on fragile incomes, spent their lives paying high GST on fuel and bikes—only now being told that the rates will drop.</p>
<p data-start="3389" data-end="3471">This isn’t a “gift.” It’s an admission that people were wronged for eight years.</p>
<hr data-start="3473" data-end="3476">
<h2 data-start="3478" data-end="3501">Beyond the Numbers</h2>
<p data-start="3502" data-end="3745">When you read headlines saying “daily items to get cheaper,” remember: if it’s cheaper now, it was unjust then. If the government celebrates lowering GST on health insurance, it means it knowingly burdened the sick and the elderly for years.</p>
<p data-start="3747" data-end="3813">Every poster celebrating “relief” is also proof of past failure.</p>
<hr data-start="3815" data-end="3818">
<h2 data-start="3820" data-end="3835">Conclusion</h2>
<p data-start="3836" data-end="4130">So, should the people celebrate? Perhaps cautiously. Yes, lower GST will bring some ease. But the larger truth remains: for eight long years, an arrogant government defended the indefensible. And only when forced by politics, economics, and pressure, did it accept what millions already knew.</p>
<p data-start="4132" data-end="4203">Relief today is not generosity. It is simply a correction of a wrong.</p>
<p data-start="4205" data-end="4292">And in history, we must remember who defended the wrong—and who dared to call it out.</p>
