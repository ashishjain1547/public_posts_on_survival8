<p data-start="255" data-end="482"><br data-start="261" data-end="264">
Donald Trump has just delivered what may be the single biggest jolt to India’s IT sector in recent memory. A shock so severe that its aftershocks will be felt from Silicon Valley to Bengaluru, and from Patna to Pune.</p>
<p data-start="484" data-end="785">The announcement came late Friday evening when the U.S. President signed an executive order creating a new immigration program under the name <strong data-start="626" data-end="649">“Project Firewall.”</strong> Overnight, the dream of Indian engineers and students who looked to America as their land of opportunity has turned into a nightmare.</p>
<hr data-start="787" data-end="790">
<h2 data-start="792" data-end="842">What Changed? From ₹6 Lakh to $100,000 a Year</h2>
<p data-start="844" data-end="1009">Until recently, renewing an H-1B visa cost roughly ₹6 lakh (around $7,200). Under Trump’s new order, that figure skyrockets to <strong data-start="971" data-end="990">$100,000 a year</strong> (over ₹83 lakh).</p>
<p data-start="1011" data-end="1150">This is no minor policy tweak. It’s a financial wall designed to push foreign workers—most of them Indian—out of the U.S. tech ecosystem.</p>
<p data-start="1152" data-end="1449">Companies aren’t going to foot such a massive bill for every employee. And if they do, they’ll simply slash salaries to recover the cost. The math is brutal: thousands of Indian engineers in the U.S. are staring at job losses, with many possibly being forced to return to India almost overnight.</p>
<hr data-start="1451" data-end="1454">
<h2 data-start="1456" data-end="1493">Panic on Both Sides of the Ocean</h2>
<p data-start="1495" data-end="1531">The ripple effects were immediate:</p>
<ul data-start="1533" data-end="1856">
<li data-start="1533" data-end="1584">
<p data-start="1535" data-end="1584">Advisories went out inside American tech firms.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1585" data-end="1629">
<p data-start="1587" data-end="1629">Lawyers were flooded with frantic calls.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1630" data-end="1726">
<p data-start="1632" data-end="1726">Families back in India grew restless, unsure if their loved ones would even keep their jobs.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1727" data-end="1856">
<p data-start="1729" data-end="1856">Engineers currently traveling outside the U.S. were told to return within <strong data-start="1803" data-end="1815">20 hours</strong> or risk being denied entry altogether.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1858" data-end="1992">What was once a steady stream of middle-class Indian families building better futures abroad has suddenly become a flood of anxiety.</p>
<hr data-start="1994" data-end="1997">
<h2 data-start="1999" data-end="2026">The Politics of Labels</h2>
<p data-start="2028" data-end="2103">At the heart of this order lies something more insidious than just money.</p>
<p data-start="2105" data-end="2289">The official White House memo justifying the hike brands the H-1B program as “abused” and accuses foreign workers of harming American jobs and even <strong data-start="2253" data-end="2287">threatening national security.</strong></p>
<p data-start="2291" data-end="2570">Let’s be clear: <strong data-start="2307" data-end="2340">most H-1B holders are Indian.</strong> For decades, they’ve been the backbone of U.S. tech firms, paying billions in taxes, boosting the housing market, funding schools, and keeping hospitals staffed. Yet today, they are being recast from <em data-start="2541" data-end="2549">talent</em> to <em data-start="2553" data-end="2568">infiltrators.</em></p>
<p data-start="2572" data-end="2778">It is the same language we’ve seen elsewhere—whether in U.S. politics around Mexican immigrants or in Indian politics around “infiltrators” closer to home. The playbook is the same: use fear to win votes.</p>
<hr data-start="2780" data-end="2783">
<h2 data-start="2785" data-end="2819">A Failure of Indian Diplomacy</h2>
<p data-start="2821" data-end="2857">This is not happening in a vacuum.</p>
<p data-start="2859" data-end="3086">In June 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and announced, to loud applause, that H-1B renewals would now be processed within the U.S., no longer requiring a trip back to India. Crowds cheered, “Modi, Modi.”</p>
<p data-start="3088" data-end="3268">Fast forward to September 2025, and those same H-1B workers are staring down the steepest visa wall in history. What happened to that pilot project? Where is the promised relief?</p>
<p data-start="3270" data-end="3415">India’s foreign policy, often showcased as a string of hugs, handshakes, and photo-ops, has been reduced to silence in the face of this crisis.</p>
<hr data-start="3417" data-end="3420">
<h2 data-start="3422" data-end="3463">The Bigger Picture: Project Firewall</h2>
<p data-start="3465" data-end="3673">Trump’s choice of name isn’t accidental. In computing, a firewall blocks outsiders from entering your system. By calling this crackdown <strong data-start="3601" data-end="3621">Project Firewall</strong>, the message is clear: keep Indian engineers out.</p>
<p data-start="3675" data-end="3849">The comparison to his much-discussed “big, beautiful wall” with Mexico is unavoidable. The same metaphor, the same politics—only this time, aimed squarely at Indian talent.</p>
<p data-start="3851" data-end="3954">And let’s not forget: Indians make up <strong data-start="3889" data-end="3924">72–73% of the entire H-1B pool.</strong> No community is hit harder.</p>
<hr data-start="3956" data-end="3959">
<h2 data-start="3961" data-end="3980">The Human Cost</h2>
<p data-start="3982" data-end="4025">This is not just about policy or numbers.</p>
<p data-start="4027" data-end="4040">It’s about:</p>
<ul data-start="4041" data-end="4471">
<li data-start="4041" data-end="4159">
<p data-start="4043" data-end="4159">Families who took out massive loans to send their children to U.S. universities, now left staring at closed doors.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="4160" data-end="4271">
<p data-start="4162" data-end="4271">Five hundred thousand Indian professionals currently on H-1B visas, half of whom could be forced to return.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="4272" data-end="4361">
<p data-start="4274" data-end="4361">Remittances worth <strong data-start="4292" data-end="4314">$35 billion a year</strong> flowing from the U.S. to India, now at risk.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="4362" data-end="4471">
<p data-start="4364" data-end="4471">Entire neighborhoods in Bihar, Andhra, and Tamil Nadu where one U.S. paycheck supports multiple families.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="4473" data-end="4582">The dream of global mobility is collapsing into the nightmare of sudden deportations and shrinking futures.</p>
<hr data-start="4584" data-end="4587">
<h2 data-start="4589" data-end="4612">Can India Respond?</h2>
<p data-start="4614" data-end="4802">At the very least, India’s government should be holding press conferences, spelling out what this means for its citizens, and taking a strong diplomatic stand. Instead, there is silence.</p>
<p data-start="4804" data-end="4985">When it comes to tariffs, sanctions, or defense deals, Washington speaks and New Delhi listens. When it comes to Indian engineers being labeled infiltrators, where is the outrage?</p>
<p data-start="4987" data-end="5182">The truth is uncomfortable: <strong data-start="5015" data-end="5100">foreign policy built on personal friendships and photo-ops was never real policy.</strong> It was always theater. And today, that theater is being exposed for what it is.</p>
<hr data-start="5184" data-end="5187">
<h2 data-start="5189" data-end="5238">Conclusion: A Dark Day for India’s Engineers</h2>
<p data-start="5240" data-end="5448">For decades, ordinary Indian families sent their children to study and work abroad, believing hard work would bring upward mobility. That belief powered India’s IT boom and changed the fortunes of millions.</p>
<p data-start="5450" data-end="5610">Now, those same families are being told to pack up and return. But the jobs, salaries, and opportunities that took them overseas simply do not exist in India.</p>
<p data-start="5612" data-end="5670">This isn’t just a visa crisis. It is a <strong data-start="5651" data-end="5668">dream crisis.</strong></p>
<p data-start="5672" data-end="5882">Project Firewall has revealed the fragility of India’s global standing and the vulnerability of its brightest minds. The question is: will India confront this reality—or once again drown it out with applause?</p>
