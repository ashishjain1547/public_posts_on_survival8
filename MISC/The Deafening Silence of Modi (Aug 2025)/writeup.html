<div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;"><h2>The Deafening Silence: When Trump Called India a "Dead Economy" and Modi's Government Said Nothing</h2><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The words landed like a wrecking ball: <strong>"dead economy."</strong> Former US President Donald Trump, never known for diplomatic subtlety, didn't just critique India's economic policies; he delivered a brutal, public obituary. "They can take their dead economy down," he declared dismissively, lumping India with Russia in a sweeping condemnation during a campaign speech. Adding insult to injury, he quipped that perhaps one day, India might even buy oil from Pakistan – a remark dripping with sarcasm and geopolitical insensitivity, knowing full well the fraught history between the two nations.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This wasn't a minor policy disagreement. This was a direct, personal, and deeply humiliating attack on the economic standing of the world's fifth-largest economy. And the response from the government that tirelessly trumpets India's rise to becoming the "third largest economy"? <strong>Deafening silence.</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This silence isn't just puzzling; it's alarming. It speaks volumes about the state of India's foreign policy and national self-respect under the current dispensation.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Beyond Tariffs: An Assault on Sovereignty and Dignity</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Trump's rant wasn't confined to tariffs. While the 25% tariff announcement on certain Indian goods (effective August 1st) is a serious economic blow impacting exports, jobs, and sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles, and electronics, his other comments crossed a critical line:</p><ol start="1"><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>The "Dead Economy" Slur:</strong> This isn't policy critique; it's a wholesale dismissal of India's economic reality and potential. It ignores growth metrics (however contested) and the sheer scale of the Indian market. It's an insult aimed at the nation.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Sanctions for Dealing with Russia:</strong> Trump effectively threatened sanctions ("fines") on India for purchasing Russian oil and weapons, asserting US authority over India's sovereign right to choose its energy and defense partners. This blatant interference demands a robust rebuttal.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>The Pakistan Oil Jibe:</strong> The suggestion that India might buy oil from Pakistan, punctuated with sarcasm, wasn't innocent trade speculation. It was a calculated dig, exploiting historical tensions to belittle India. It questioned India's energy autonomy and geopolitical standing.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>"Noxious" Non-Tariff Barriers:</strong> Dismissing India's regulatory frameworks (like import licenses, customs checks) as "noxious" is an insult to the nation's administrative structures and its right to set its own trade rules.</p></li></ol><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>The Government's Stunning Muteness</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The government's reaction? Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal spoke in Parliament... but <em>only</em> about the tariffs and ongoing trade talks. The "dead economy" label? The sanctions threat? The Pakistan jibe? <strong>Ignored.</strong> The Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman? Silent. The External Affairs Minister, Jaishankar, known for sharp retorts to European queries on Russian oil? Mysteriously quiet. The Prime Minister? Invisible on the issue.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This silence is unprecedented. When China faced similar tariff threats or criticism, its Foreign Ministry issued swift, strong rebuttals. When Trump pressured Germany on Nord Stream, Merkel defended Germany's interests. Brazil's Lula openly challenged Trump's attempts to undermine their sovereignty. Yet, India, aspiring to be a global leader, offers only bureaucratic murmurs about "studying the impact" and "protecting national interests" – <em>after</em> the national dignity has been publicly trampled.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Selective Outrage and Political Theater</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The silence becomes even more jarring when contrasted with the government's usual rhetoric. Ministers and the BJP machinery are quick to pounce on opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi for echoing concerns about the economy. When Gandhi noted Trump's "dead economy" remark reflected the ground reality (citing demonetization, GST, etc.), the BJP erupted in condemnation of <em>him</em>, not Trump.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This exposes a dangerous hypocrisy. Nationalism, fiercely brandished domestically against political opponents, evaporates when a foreign leader insults the nation. The "56-inch chest" seems to shrink in the face of Trump's bluster. Where are the fiery defences of "Bharat Mata's" honour now?</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>The Cost of Failed Foreign Policy and Personalised Diplomacy</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Ravish Kumar's core argument resonates: <strong>India's foreign policy appears catastrophically adrift.</strong> What should be focused on securing national interests – protecting the economy, ensuring strategic autonomy, building strong alliances – seems subsumed by a focus on personal PR and projecting the Prime Minister's image. The much-hyped "bromance" with Trump, showcased in events like "Howdy Modi," now stands exposed as hollow theatrology.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This personalised diplomacy has yielded:</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Humiliation:</strong> Enduring public insults without response.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Economic Vulnerability:</strong> Facing damaging tariffs with no clear counter-strategy.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Strategic Weakness:</strong> Appearing unable to defend sovereign decisions (like buying Russian oil) against US pressure, unlike China.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Damaged Credibility:</strong> The silence on Trump's insults makes the government's boasts about global standing ring hollow.</p></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>The Ghost of "Howdy Modi" and the Questions that Remain</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The images of Modi sharing the stage with Trump in Houston, basking in chants of "Howdy Modi," now seem like a cruel joke. The "friend of India" turned accuser, calling its economy dead, while the Indian Prime Minister remains mute. The contrast is stark and deeply embarrassing for the nation.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Critical questions hang in the air, unanswered by the government's silence:</strong></p><ol start="1"><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Why the lack of immediate, unequivocal condemnation?</strong> Basic diplomatic protocol demands a response to such egregious insults.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>What leverage does Trump hold over Modi?</strong> The consistent silence suggests something beyond typical diplomatic friction.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Is national dignity now negotiable?</strong> At what cost is the government pursuing its undefined "deal" with the US?</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Where is the strategic autonomy?</strong> Capitulating to threats of sanctions over sovereign energy choices is a sign of weakness, not strength.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>How will India welcome Trump if he visits for the Quad summit?</strong> Will the architect of the "dead economy" slur be feted with silver thalis after such an affront?</p></li></ol><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Conclusion: Silence is Not Strength</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Trump's "dead economy" remark wasn't just an economic assessment; it was a grenade thrown at India's national pride and global standing. The Modi government's failure to pick it up and throw it back, its refusal to even loudly say "We reject this," is not strategic patience. It's a failure of nerve, a dereliction of duty, and a stark admission of the hollowness of its projected strongman image and the bankruptcy of its current foreign policy.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The cost of this silence isn't just measured in potential tariff impacts or diplomatic points lost. It's measured in the erosion of national self-respect and the dangerous signal it sends to the world: that India can be insulted with impunity. Until the government finds its voice and forcefully defends the nation's honour and interests, the label "dead economy" will resonate less as Trump's hyperbole and more as an epitaph for India's diplomatic spine. The silence is deafening, and it speaks of a profound national humiliation.</p></div>
