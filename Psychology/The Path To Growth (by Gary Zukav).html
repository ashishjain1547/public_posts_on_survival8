    &nbsp;This article draws your attention to the vertical path, the path to growth, and to the difference between the
    vertical path and the horizontal path.<br /><br />The vertical path is the path of awareness. It is the path of
    consciousness and conscious choice. The person who chooses to advance his or her spiritual growth, to cultivate
    awareness of his or her higher self, is on a vertical path. The vertical path is the path of clarity. The potential
    for the creation of clarity and the experience of interacting with your nonphysical Teacher are one and the same.<br /><br />The
    horizontal path is the path that satisfies your personality. A businessman or a businesswoman, for example, who
    devotes his or her life to the accumulation of money is on a horizontal path. No matter how diverse his or her
    ventures may become, they are essentially identical. If they make money, they please the personality, and if they
    lose money, they distress the personality, but they do not serve the higher self. They do not serve his or her
    spiritual growth.<br /><br />A person that seeks relationships only to gratify his or her own needs, such as his or
    her own emotional or sexual needs, will find that each relationship is essentially identical, that the people in
    his or her life are replaceable, that experiences with the first and experiences with the second are essentially
    the same. This is the horizontal path. Each new experience is not really new. It is more of the same thing. To
    experience relationships of substance and depth requires approaching and entering into relationships with
    consciousness and concern for the other. That is the vertical path.<br /><br />This does not mean that learning
    does not occur in all situations, and that when a horizontal path is no longer appropriate to a soul's learning,
    that soul will not leave it behind. Sooner or later, each soul will turn toward authentic power. Every situation
    serves this goal, and every soul will reach it. The vertical path begins with the decision to do that consciously.<br />
