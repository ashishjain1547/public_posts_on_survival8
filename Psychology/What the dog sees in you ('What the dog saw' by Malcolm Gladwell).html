<p>The anthropologist Brian Hare has done experiments with dogs, for example, where he puts a piece of food under one of
    two cups, placed several feet apart. The dog knows that there is food to be had, but has no idea which of the cups
    holds the prize. Then Hare points at the right cup, taps on it, looks directly at it. What happens? The dog goes to
    the right cup virtually every time. Yet when Hare did the same experiment with chimpanzees — an animal that shares
    98.6 percent of our genes — the chimps couldn’t get it right. A dog will look at you for help, and a chimp won’t.
    “Primates are very good at using the cues of the same species,” Hare explained. “So if we were able to do a similar
    game, and it was a chimp or another primate giving a social cue, they might do better. But they are not good at
    using human cues when you are trying to cooperate with them. They don’t get it: ‘Why would you ever tell me where
    the food is?’</p>
<p>The key specialization of dogs, though, is that dogs pay attention to humans, when humans are doing something very
    human, which is sharing information about something that someone else might actually want.” Dogs aren’t smarter than
    chimps; they just have a different attitude toward people. “Dogs are really interested in humans,” Hare went on. “
    Interested to the point of obsession. To a dog, you are a giant walking tennis ball.”</p>
<p>A dog cares, deeply, which way your body is leaning. Forward or backward? Forward can be seen as aggressive; backward
    — even a quarter of an inch — means nonthreatening. It means you’ve relinquished what ethologists call an intention
    movement to proceed forward. Cock your head, even slightly, to the side, and a dog is disarmed. Look at him straight
    on and he’ll read it like a red flag. Standing straight, with your shoulders squared, rather than slumped, can mean
    the difference between whether your dog obeys a command or ignores it.</p>
<p>Breathing even and deeply — rather than holding your breath — can mean the difference between defusing a tense
    situation and igniting it. “I think they are looking at our eyes and where our eyes are looking, and what our eyes
    look like,” the ethologist Patricia McConnell, who teaches at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, says. “A rounded
    eye with a dilated pupil is a sign of high arousal and aggression in a dog. I believe they pay a tremendous amount
    of attention to how relaxed our face is and how relaxed our facial muscles are, because that’s a big cue for them
    with each other. Is the jaw relaxed? Is the mouth slightly open? And then the arms. They pay a tremendous amount of
    attention to where our arms go.”</p>
<p>In the book The Other End of the Leash, McConnell decodes one of the most common of all human-dog interactions — the
    meeting between two leashed animals on a walk. To us, it’s about one dog sizing up another. To her, it’s about two
    dogs sizing up each other after first sizing up their respective owners. The owners “are often anxious about how
    well the dogs will get along,” she writes, “and if you watch them instead of the dogs, you’ll often notice that the
    humans will hold their breath and round their eyes and mouths in an ‘on alert’ expression. Since these behaviors are
    expressions of offensive aggression in canine culture, I suspect that the humans are unwittingly signaling tension.
    If you exaggerate this by tightening the leash, as many owners do, you can actually cause the dogs to attack each
    other. Think of it: the dogs are in a tense social encounter, surrounded by support from their own pack, with the
    humans forming a tense, staring, breathless circle around them. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen dogs shift
    their eyes toward their owner’s frozen faces, and then launch growling at the other dog.”</p>
