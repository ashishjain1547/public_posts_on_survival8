    <span style="font-size: xx-small;">(Self-portrait of a person with schizophrenia, representing that individual's perception of the distorted experience
        of reality in the disorder)</span>
    <br />
    <br /> The word "Schizophrenia" was coined by&nbsp;Paul Eugen Bleuler (30 April 1857 – 15 July 1939), it is derived from two
    Greek words "skhizein" meaning "to split" and "phren" meaning "mind".
    <br />
    <br /> Few definitions of this word:
    <br /> A long-term mental disorder of a type involving a breakdown in the relation between thought, emotion, and behavior,
    leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships
    into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation. (Google Dictionary)
    <br />
    <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real.
    Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced
    social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional
    mental health problems such as anxiety disorders, major depressive illness, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically
    come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. (Wikipedia)
    <br />
    <br /> Confusing, yeah, let me start over...
    <br />
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Schizo means to split, phrenia in this case refers to the mind even though schizophrenia can be interpreted to mean splitting
        of the mind, it does not refer to the split personality like some media sources might portray. Rather schizophrenia
        describes scattered or fragmented pattern of thinking.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Schizophrenia is actually a syndrome meaning there are all sorts of symptoms that might be associated with it and different
        patients might experience different symptoms. Although symptoms can be broadly categorized under three major areas:
        positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Alright, taking a step back, most human symptoms from any illness are extreme version of a normal physiological process for
        example everyone has a heartbeat, right, tachycardia is a fast heartbeat. In the same way, everyone has a normal
        body temperature but during a fever, that temperature is higher.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        In schizophrenia, patients have positive symptoms, which aren't positive is the sense that they are helpful but positive
        in the sense they are some new feature that does not have a normal or physiologic counterpart.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        These are psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and disorganized or catatonic behavior;
        none of which occur physiologically.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Delusions are false beliefs that the person might feel very strongly about so much so that they will not change their mind
        even if you gave them evidence against it. There are all sorts of different delusions like for example a delusion
        of control where somebody thinks that some outside source or person or thing is controlling their actions.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        There can be delusions of reference where someone might think that insignificant remarks are directed at them, like a newscaster
        is speaking directly to them through the TV.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Hallucinations are a second type of positive symptoms and there can be any kind of sensation that is not actually there,
        including visual but also including auditory sensations like hearing voices or commands.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        A third type is disorganized speech, an example being something like a word salad which seems just like a random jumbling
        of the words or phrases like "pencil, dog, hat, coffee, blue!"
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Disorganized behavior, on the other hand, could be like an exhibit of bizarre or silly behavior that is out of context and
        does not seem to have much of a purpose, like for example, wearing multiple layers of jackets on a hot summer day.
        Also sometimes, there may be behavior that is described as catatonic, which has to do with their movements, postures
        and responsiveness. So like, they might be super resistant to moving or being an unresponsive stupor.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Negative symptoms are when there is reduction or removal of normal processes. In addition, this is like a decrease in emotions
        that they can express or a loss in interest in things that they once found interesting.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        One type of negative symptom is called flat affect where they do not respond with an emotional reaction, which would seem
        inappropriate. Like if they saw something very unexpected like a small monkey playing in the living room, they might
        simply sit and watch idly as if nothing was happening.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Another type is alogia or poverty of speech, which a lack of content in their speech so like if somebody asked them "Do you
        have any children?", they might respond with "Yes.", instead of "yeah, one boy and two girls".
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        A third type of negative symptom is avolition, which is the decrease in motivation to complete certain goals so some of them
        might stay at home for a long period of time without trying to reach out the friends or find work.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Cognitive symptoms are like not being able to remember things, learn new things or understand other things easily. These
        symptoms are more subtle though, they are more difficult to notice and might only be detected if there are really
        specific tests for them. Example would be somebody not being able to keep track of several things at once, like a
        phone number and an address.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        People with schizophrenia seem to cycle through three phases, typically in order. During the prodromal phase, patients might
        become withdrawn and spend most of their time alone and a lot of times, it seems similar to other mental disorders
        like depression or anxiety disorder. During the active phase, patients experience more severe symptoms like delusions,
        hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior or catatonic behavior. Following an active phase, patients
        are often enter into a residual phase where they might exhibit cognitive symptoms like not being able to concentrate
        or becoming withdrawn again as with the prodromal phase.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        For an official diagnosis of schizophrenia (DSM-V), patients need to be diagnosed with two of the following:
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        1. Delusions
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        2. Hallucinations
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        3. Disorganized speech
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        4. Disorganized / catatonic behavior
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        5. Negative symptoms
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Also, at least one of them has to be one of these:
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        1. Delusions
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        2. Hallucinations
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        3. Disorganized speech
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        So basically, they could not have just disorganized behavior and negative symptoms. Even though some patients might have
        cognitive symptoms as well, they are not specifically needed for diagnosis. Also though for a diagnosis, signs of
        these disturbances must be ongoing for at least 6 months, meaning that they are likely in one phase or another for
        a period of 6 months but there must be at least one month of “active” phase symptoms.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Finally, those symptoms cannot be attributed to another condition, like substance abuse.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Now that we have diagnosed it, why does it even happen in the first place? What causes schizophrenia? Well, researchers do
        not really know, since it seems that signs and symptoms of schizophrenia are pretty unique to humans, or at least
        they are hard to imagine or notice in animal models like mice or rats (“Is this rat delusional?”). One clue is that
        that majority of anti-psychotic medication that improves schizophrenia symptoms blocks the dopamine receptors “D2”
        which reduces dopamine levels in neurons. This thing suggests may be schizophrenia has something to do with the increased
        levels of dopamine. These medications are though neither universally nor completely effective and do not work for
        everyone with schizophrenia which adds to the confusion that there is probably more to the story than just the D2
        receptors. Interestingly, one of the most effective anti-psychotic drugs is a weak D2 antagonist (blocker) so just
        seems that other neurotransmitter systems norepinephrine, serotonin and GABA are probably involved.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Twin studies have shown to support the genetic basis as well, even though there have not been any specific genes conclusively
        linked to schizophrenia yet.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        In addition, environmental factors like early/prenatal exposure to infections, and certain autoimmune disorders like celiac
        disease have been linked with schizophrenia.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Finally, an important set of clues involve the epidemiology, schizophrenia seems to happen slightly more in men than in women
        with onset in the mid-twenties for men but late twenties for women and a clinical signs for schizophrenia are often
        less severe. Some studies suggest differences might be due to estrogen regulation of dopamine systems. There however
        does not seem to be any difference among the race.
        <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Now treating schizophrenia can be really tricky and anti-psychotic medications are often used but it is super important to
        combine the efforts of several explanations/disciplines and health professionals including professionals in therapy
        and counseling, medicine, and psychopharmacology. Anti-psychotics can be very effective at reducing symptoms but
        they often come with a lot of additional considerations to keep in mind like cost and potential for unwanted side
        effects like tolerance, dependency or withdrawal.
        <br />
        <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
            Final word, schizophrenia is not curable but treatable and could last life long. It is a serious mental illness that is diagnosed
            to 3.2 million people in the population every year. About 0.3–0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia during
            their lifetimes. In 2013, there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. About 20% of people do well, and
            a few recover completely.
